<p>You have the coronavirus. The Municipal Public Health Service (GGD) would like you to comply with the following rules, so that you donâ€™t pass the virus on to others:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>In all cases, stay at home until five days have passed since the start of your symptoms. Do not receive visitors.</strong></li>
    <li>If there are other people in your household, avoid contact with them. Stay in your own room and also sleep there by yourself. Do not let other members of your household enter this room.</li>
    <li>Do not go outside until five days have passed since the start of your symptoms and you have not had any symptoms for at least 24 hours. Symptoms include fever, coughing, sore throat and rhinitis. If you still have symptoms after five days, stay at home until you have not had any symptoms for at least 24 hours, at most up to and including 10 days after the start of your symptoms.</li>
    <li>Stay away from vulnerable people until 10 days have passed since the start of your symptoms.</li>
    <li>Warn people you had contact with from two days before the start of your symptoms until the time you started self-isolating. Please refer these people to <a href="https://mijnvraagovercorona.nl/en">mijnvraagovercorona.nl/en</a>.</li>
    <li>If you have not had any symptoms at all, the above points apply from the day of the (self-)test instead of the day on which you started having symptoms.</li>
    <li>If you have been to a childcare centre, primary school or secondary school, let those institutions know that you are infected.</li>
    <li>If you work in healthcare, discuss your return to work with your employer or company physician.</li>
    <li>Regularly wash your hands with water and soap, and cough or sneeze into the crook of your elbow.</li>
</ul>
