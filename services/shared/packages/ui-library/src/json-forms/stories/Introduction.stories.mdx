# JsonForms

[JsonForms](https://jsonforms.io/) was introduced to the ui-library to provide more flexiblilty when it comes 
to setting up forms. The goal of these components is to create a framework 
which will set up an entire form soley based on an API response. This gives the 
backend more options and control for creating new and updating existing forms.

JsonForms will generate an entire form based on the `data`, `(JSON) schema` and `uiSchema` that is provided.

For more information on JSON forms, please refer to the official documentation:

- [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io/).
- [JSON Forms Vue 2](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/master/packages/vue2/vue2).
- [JSON Forms Vue 2 vanilla](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/master/packages/vue2/vue2-vanilla) _(for some example implementations)_.
- [JSON Forms React vanilla](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/master/packages/vanilla-renderers/src) _(for some example implementations)_.

There are 3 main components responsible for the working of a form: `JsonForms`, `JsonFormsChild` and `JsonFormsBase`.

```
JsonForms
└── JsonFormsChild     <───────────────────┐
    └── JsonFormsBase                      │
        - renderers                        │
          ├── ChildFormControl           ──┤
          ├── ChildFormCollectionControl ──┘
          ├── RadioButtonGroup
          ├── ...Layouts
          └── ...Other controls 
```

### `JsonForms`

The `JsonForms` is the _main component_ and also the _only_ component that is exported from the `ui-library`. 
It extends the `JsonFormsChild` component and serves as the root of the form.
It is responsible for keeping a local state of the _complete_ form data which is shown in the Form. It also 
combines the child form change events with its own change events and emits this as a single `change` event 
for the implementation.

It takes a `formActionHandler` as a prop which it provides for its underlying components. 
A `formActionHandler` can be used by child components for making calls to the backend.

### `JsonFormsChild`

The `JsonFormsChild` extends the `JsonFormsBase` component. If provided, it uses the `formActionHandler` to push updates to the backend. It also maps soms meta data to the `JsonFormsBase`.

### `JsonFormsBase`

The `JsonFormsBase` extends the original `vue2/JsonForms` component. It contains the main configuration for the `vue2/JsonForms` component.

Child forms (or sub forms) are rendered via the `ChildFormControl` or `ChildFormCollectionControl`. They proved a way to have changes pushed to a different endpoint than the main form. This is done via the `$links` meta data.

## FormData

The form data that is used by the `JsonForms` / `JsonFormsChild` is a bit different than the pure data that would normally used by JSON forms.
Because next to the actual data, it also contains certain meta data that is used by the form. 
This can include validation errors, links that are used for communication with the backend and also links to new forms entirely.

> Note that a form can contain multiple child forms. This is done by passing another `FormData` object within the data (`T`).

```
export type FormData<T = any> = {
    ...T;
    $validationErrors?: FormError[];
    $links: {
        self?: RequestConfig;
        create?: RequestConfig;
        update?: RequestConfig;
        delete?: RequestConfig;
    };
};
```
