# Component guidelines

To help write structured and reusable components for the UI library we have compiled a list of guidelines
that everyone should try to follow. If you disagree or have issues with any of them please bring this up
at the next frontend chapter to discuss.

## Get inspired

Don't reinvent the wheel, have a look how other component libraries approach components and their properties.
Some good libraries are: 

- [Chakra ui](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components)
- [Material ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/)
- [Vue tailwind](https://www.vue-tailwind.com/docs/installation/)


## Design System components

When implementing components from the design system the **implementation details are the responsibility of the
developers**. We need to match the visual design from the figma files, but we **don't need to match any properties**
that might be listed in there. Designed components from the design system may also be split up
into multiple components if this keeps the implementation details simpler and more maintainable.

> Some designs are also depedend on the context in which they are in. <br/>
> _For example a bold link doesn't neccessarily need to be an option of a `Link` component, but can simply inherited from the parent style. (e.g. a link that is wrapped in a `<b>` tag)_

However when a component is finished and the implementation details are clear. We should aim to have the
related figma files updated to the implementation details as well.

## Component files

A component should be completely self-contained inside it's own folder. This folder contains the main component file, tests, stories, all its assets and anything else it might need. 
Anything that is to be used accross multiple components will be turned into its own component and be documented accordingly.
A component directory and its contents may look as follows:

```
components/
|-- MyComponent/
    |-- MyComponent.vue
    |-- MyComponent.stories.ts
    |-- MyComponent.spec.ts
    |-- MyComponentPart.vue
    |-- images/
        |-- asset-1.jpeg
        |-- asset-2.jpeg
```

## `<template>` content

### Keep it simple

If the template becomes bigger than ~30+ lines consider splitting it up into multiple components. This can help to reduce complexity and keep things more readable.


### Slot vs property

When to use a slot or a propery might not always be clear. But in general:

Use a `<slot />`

- For text content when the component only has a single slot and it's the main content of the component (button text, paragraph text).
- For content that maybe also contain other components.

Use a `prop="value"`

- When the content can only contain `string` values (such as attributes, placeholder text or label) - and it is __not__ the "main" content of the component (see first item above).
- To specify required - or - restrict attributes
- To apply common use cases to simplify the usage of the component.


## Properties

### Be descriptive 

Try to describe the effect of a property so it is easy to understand when looking at the implementation.

**Don't** use properties such as

-   `variant="primary"`
-   `variant="secondary"`
-   `variant="tertiary"`
-   `destructive`

**Do** use properties such as

-   `variant="solid"`
-   `variant="outline"`
-   `variant="plain"`
-   `color="red"`

### Use strict types

All properties should be typed as strictly as possible.

For commons properties such as `size` use the types that are predefined in the `types.d.ts` so the implementation is the same accross all components.

```
import type { Extends, Sizes } from '../../types';

type Size = Extends<Sizes, 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'>;

...

export default defineComponent({
    props: {
        size: { type: String as PropType<Size>, default: 'sm' },
    },
...
```
 
## Styling 

Often you will want to apply certain styles based on a property value or even a combination of values. We recommend that you use a `Record<Property, string[]>` to define the different styles.

```
<template>
    <button :class="styles">
        <slot />
    <button>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
type Variant = 'solid' | 'outline';
type Color = 'violet' | 'red';

const variantStyles: Record<Variant, string[]> = {
    solid: ['tw-text-white'],
    outline: ['tw-bg-white', 'tw-border-gray-200'],
};

const colorStyles: Record<`${Color}-${Variant}`, string[]> = {
    ['violet-solid']: ['tw-bg-violet-700', 'hover:tw-bg-violet-800', 'tw-border-violet-700'],
    ['violet-outline']: ['tw-text-violet-700', 'hover:tw-text-violet-800', 'hover:tw-border-violet-800'],
    ['red-solid']: ['tw-bg-red-600', 'tw-border-red-600', 'hover:tw-bg-red-700'],
    ['red-outline']: ['tw-text-red-600', 'hover:tw-text-red-700', 'hover:tw-border-red-700', 'focus:tw-text-red-700'],
};

export default defineComponent({
    props: {
        variant: { type: String as PropType<Variant>, default: 'solid' },
        color: { type: String as PropType<Color>, default: 'violet' },
    },
    setup({ variant, color }) {
        const styles = [
            ...variantStyles[variant],
            ...colorStyles[`${color}-${variant}`]
        ]

         return { styles };
    },
...
```
